## Basic Design.

### Schematic entry.

#### Schematic files.

Schematics are prepared with gschem version 1.6.2.20110115, a schematic
entry application part of the GPL'd EDA suite of tools "gschem and
friends" (geda-gaf).

Attributes for symbols are managed either from within gschem, or with
gattrib, the attribute editing application from the same suite of tools.

Schematic files can be found here: [link to schematic files](../ecad/gschem)

#### Design Rule Check (DRC).

After schematic entry a check is done by running gnetlist with the
"geda" backend as to visually check for missing reference designators,
missing device values, shorted nets and not connected pins on symbols.

The gnetlist backend "geda" will list components, renamed nets, and
resulting connectivity of nets in a structured list.

DRC files can be found here: [link to DRC files](../ecad/gschem/DRC)

#### Bill Of materials (BOM).

Preliminary BOMs are generated from schematics by running gnetlist with the "bom" backend.

BOM files can be found here: [link to BOM files](../ecad/gschem/BOM)

### Calculations.

...

### Simulations.

#### gnucap simulations.

##### Schematic files (graphic representation only).

Schematic representations of circuits for simulation were prepared with
gschem.

##### Input files.

Various circuit files (*.ckt) contain subcircuits (operational
amplifier) and calls to (diode and transistor) models included in the
gnucap software package.

##### Data files.

For every module, section and response type, a single data file was
generated by gnucap by means of a Makefile rule.

##### Data processing files.

For every required output graph a gnuplot post processing job was done.

##### Output files.

Output files are typically Portable Network Graphic files (*.png).

Default size of graphs is 640 by 480 pixels.

Detailed graphs were made where required.

##### Discussion of results.

All input files were processed with gnucap version 0.35 and all data
files were processed with gnuplot version 4.2 patchlevel 6.
